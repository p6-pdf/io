It's becoming apparent that there's important bits of information scattered
all over the Perl6 PDF Tool-chain.

On top of that, it's not clear, navigating each of the modules how they inter-operate and inter-relate.

I've also got issues deciding what to put in README files for each of the sub-projects and what to put in POD in the various sources. At this early stage, we don't have CPAN, or an equivalent. So stuff in POD can be a bit hidden.

Seems the best thing to do is to decouple the documentation and put it into a seperate manuiscript.

This is it. The root of the document is [perl6-pdf-toolchain.md](perl6-pdf-toolchain..md).

There's one additional goal. When it comes to publishing a book about a PDF tool-chain; we can dog-food by using the tool-chain to publish the book.

For this reason, I've chosen markdown as the language. It's simple, commonplace, and should be a relatively easy source language to write publication tools for.
