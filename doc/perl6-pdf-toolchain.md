## 1. Introduction

This is the documentation for the Perl 6 PDF Tool-chain.

It overviews the modules that comprise the tool-chain and gives a basic background and references to the PDF standard where needed.

Both this documentation and the PDF tool-chain are in the early stages of development and are expected to grow together as the tool-chain matures.

## 2. Overview

here's a quick run-down of the tool-chain modules (top to bottom):
```
                                [Lib::PDF]
                         -----------------------------

         |           |       V                  V
         V           |   [PDF::Content]    <-- [PDF]   <-- [PDF::Grammar]
    [PDF::Lite]   <--|       ^          
                             |

                         [PDF::Style]     <--| [CSS::Declarations]
```


### PDF Modules

#### [PDF::Lite](https://github.com/p6-pdf/PDF-Lite-p6) - Focused on authoring and basic content manipulation only.

#### [PDF::API6](https://github.com/p6-pdf/PDF-API6-p6) - Inherits from, and further extends PDF::Lite

The aim is general purpose support for reading and writing PDF files, including Forms, Meta-data, Accessibility and Font manipulation. This module is at
a prototype stage.

### PDF/HTML Suite

PDF::Style[::Font], HTML::Canvas[::To::PDF] and CSS::Declarations are designed to work together for higher level HTML/CSS flavoured PDF creation.

#### [HTML::Canvas](https://github.com/p6-pdf/HTML-Canvas-p6)

Implements the HTML5 Canvas 2D API. For simple text, graphics and images.

#### [PDF::Style](https://github.com/p6-pdf/PDF-Style-p6)

A companion module to HTML::Canvas. Allows composition with HTML positioning and CSS Styling rules and box model.

#### [CSS::Declarations](https://github.com/p6-css/CSS-Declarations-p6)

Top of the CSS tool-chain. An important companion to HTML::Canvas and PDF::Style.

### Low Level Modules

#### [PDF::Content](https://github.com/p6-pdf/PDF-Content-p6) - Roles for manipulating text, graphics and images.

Put to work by PDF::Lite and PDF::API6.

#### [PDF](https://github.com/p6-pdf/PDF-p6) - for PDF manipulation, including compression, encryption and reading and writing of PDF data.

The king-pin of the PDF tool-chain. Handles physical access to PDF files, including reading, writing, compression and encryption.

#### [PDF::Grammar](https://github.com/p6-pdf/PDF-Grammr-p6)

A collection of grammars for parsing PDF elements and content

#### [Lib::PDF](https://github.com/p6-pdf/libpdf-p6) library of decoding and encoding functions, etc.

An optional library of encoding and decoding routines, written in C for
performance. At this stage, only a few select filters are available.

### Status

#### Released: PDF::Grammar, PDF, CSS::Declarations.

#### Pending: PDF::API6, PDF::Lite, PDF::Content

#### Held Back: Lib::PDF

This module could really do with CPAN Testers style smoke testing. Also
would like to see more work on Rakudo JIT. It so far implements some of
the more obvious bottlenecks

#### Experimental: HTML::Canvas::To::PDF, PDF::Style, PDF::Style::Font

These have helped to drive development of the above modules.

Fonts need to be developed a bit more. Could be we need a Font::FreeType module;
and to integrate Cairo glyph fonts.

Some possible overlap with p6-css projects. Could be we need a top-level
Style name-space with PDF and Cairo back-ends. Similar to structure of
HTML::Canvas (with HTML::Canvas::To::Cairo and HTML::Canvas::To::PDF
back-ends).

Possibly need a top-down markdown or POD rendering project to pull this
all together.


### Alternatives

Method | Code | Description
--- | --- | ---
SetStrokeColorSpace(name) | CS | Set the current space to use for stroking operations. This can be a standard name, such as 'DeviceGray', 'DeviceRGB', 'DeviceCMYK', or a name declared in the parent's Resource<ColorSpace> dictionary.
SetStrokeColorSpace(name) | cs | Same but for nonstroking operations.
SetStrokeColor(c1, ..., cn) | SC | Set the colours to use for stroking operations in a device. The number of operands required and their interpretation depends on the current stroking colour space: DeviceGray, CalGray, and Indexed colour spaces, have one operand. DeviceRGB, CalRGB, and Lab colour spaces, three operands. DeviceCMYK has four operands.
SetStrokeColorN(c1, ..., cn [,pattern-name]) | SCN | Same as SetStrokeColor but also supports Pattern, Separation, DeviceN, ICCBased colour spaces and patterns.
SetFillColor(c1, ..., cn) | sc | Same as SetStrokeColor, but for non-stroking operations.
SetFillColorN(c1, ..., cn [,pattern-name]) | scn | Same as SetStrokeColorN, but for non-stroking operations.
SetStrokeGray(level) | G | Set the stroking colour space to DeviceGray and set the gray level to use for stroking operations, between 0.0 (black) and 1.0 (white).
SetFillGray(level) | g | Same as G but used for nonstroking operations.

SetFillRGB(r, g, b) | rg | Same as RG but used for nonstroking operations.
SetFillCMYK(c, m, y, k) | K | Set the stroking colour space to DeviceCMYK and set the colour to use for stroking operations. Each operand shall be a number between 0.0 (zero concentration) and 1.0 (maximum concentration). The behaviour of this operator is affected by the OverprintMode graphics state.
SetStrokeRGB(c, m, y, k) | k | Same as K but used for nonstroking operations.

#### Graphics State

Method | Code | Description
--- | --- | ---
Save() | q | Save the current graphics state on the graphics state stack

#### Path Construction

Method | Code | Description
--- | --- | ---
MoveTo(x, y) | m | Begin a new subpath by moving the current point to coordinates (x, y), omitting any connecting line segment. If the previous path construction operator in the current path was also m, the new m overrides it.

CurveTo(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3) | c | Append a cubic BÃ©zier curve to the current path. The curve shall extend from the current point to the point (x 3 , y 3 ), using (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ) as the BÃ©zier control points. The new current point shall be (x3 , y3 ).

#### Path Painting Operators

Method | Code | Description
--- | --- | ---
Stroke() | S | Stroke the path.
CloseStroke() | s | Close and stroke the path. Same as: $.Close; $.Stroke
